In this repository we implement the ideas discussed in [this documet from MIT](https://web.mit.edu/2.151/www/Handouts/EqFormulation.pdf) where they discuss how to describe physical systems as graphs and then how to get the equations describing the system. <br> 

We will begin by showing an example <br>
